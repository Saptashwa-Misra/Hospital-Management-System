# Hospital Management System

Being a developer, I always wanted to improve the future of the upcoming generation. A hospital management system promotes communication between providers and patients and improves patient experiences. Moreover, in an Hospital there should be no loss/misplacement of data. Manual databases are prone to damage and serching data will take lots of time and manpower. This hospital management system will help the hospital management to store, organize data and help in the smooth functionality of the same.

## FAQ

#### Why am I not allowed to book an appointment?

A patient will be allowed to have only 1 active appointment at a time. He/She will be allowed to book another appointment once his/her existing appointment is over or it is cancelled.

#### Why access code is needed to register a new admin?

Access code will be given by the hospital management to the authorised admin to prevent any unauthorised access to the portal. (At present one can check our website using the access code SAPTASHWA@ACCESS)

#### Is my password safely stored in the database?

Security is one of the most important thing which a developer should keep in mind while developing a website. Yes, your password will be encrypted before saving it in the database. So worry not :)

#### How can a patient or doctor access the portal?

At present only the admin can access the portal, but in the upcomming versions, both the doctor and patient will be able to sign in to their respective portal. Patients will be able to book his/her appointment, cancel already booked appointment, pay doctor fees online, have all past prescriptions saved, and many other features. 

#### Where is this project deployed?

Backend of this Hospital management system is deployed in Heroku and the frontend is deployed in Netlify. Source code is available in GitHub.
